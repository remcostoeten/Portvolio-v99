        description: 'A tool to convert HTML to JSX/TSX. I tend to do a lot of UI prototyping work and got tired of having to wait on the Cloudflare anti-bot loadings on other converters so I decided to build my own. This tool allows to convert any HTML (including SVGs!) to either JSX or TSX. It supports NextJS app router with client-side flags. It also is possible to generate a fully functioning component with or without props. When selecting TypeScript, it adds the props you fill in as an interface or type just how you would write it yourself. It is still in beta but the main functionality is working. The only thing left are some minor bugs and broken UI. But I have other priorities currently.',

        description: "Why you ask? I have the samem question... This was one off my probably 50 UI's i've created the past year which was going to be my portfolio site but eventually got sick off it. The landing page is very cool tho IMO so it's worth showcasing. There is one tool in there which is a tool that allows to extract urls based on certain strings. Again a tool which  I use and I'd rather host my self. But like all, it still has some bugs and is not perfect. But it works.. somewhat.",

        description: "This is a kanban board which is server side rendered. It is build with NextJS, TypeScript, Firebase as the database. This was one of my first projects ever created (without any tutorial!). It has authentication which then redirectsd to a kanban board with multiple lanes like we know from *excuses my language* Jira. Also supports drag and drop off the tasks inbetween lanes and such. Loads of features to add but i've called it a day for that project.",
