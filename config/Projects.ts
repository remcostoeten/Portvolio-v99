        text: "I tent to  do a lot of UI work with various experiments where I like basing designs in pure HTML or either copying some codepen's and converting them to jsx code. I got tired off Cloudfare protection on other converters so I ended up building my own. Currently the tool converts any HTML (including SVGS) to JSX/TSX. It also is possible to generate a fully working component with NextJS client (approuter) support. You're able to fill in the component name and additional props which then spits out a fully functioning component with either interfaces of types. It's still in beta and not ready yet for a 1.0 release as the UI is kinda buggy and some other bugs remain, but I have other priorities at the moment. I will be working on this project in the future.",
